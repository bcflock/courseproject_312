# courseproject_312

Contains the files needed to setup the environment for the Benjamin Flock/Eli Abboud/Kevin Felt CSDS312 project on the use of High Performance Computing resources in neuroradiology


All python files are originially from the [`Mehrdad-Noori/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation`](https://github.com/Mehrdad-Noori/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation) repository. (I know how to fork, it just didn't give the right directory structure in this case.)
